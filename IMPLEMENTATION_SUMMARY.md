# Employee Management System - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Completed Tasks & Fixes

### âœ… 1. Critical Bug Fixes

#### Fixed Missing Methods in EmployeeService
- **Issue**: `EmployeeController` was calling `updateEmployeeStatus()` and `updateEmployee()` methods that didn't exist
- **Solution**: Added both methods with proper implementation including validation and auditing

#### Fixed Missing PUT Endpoint in EmployeeController
- **Issue**: No update endpoint for employee records
- **Solution**: Added `PUT /api/employees/{id}` endpoint for complete employee updates

#### Fixed Authentication Flow
- **Issue**: `UserService` was creating new `BCryptPasswordEncoder` instances
- **Solution**: Injected `BCryptPasswordEncoder` as a Spring bean for consistency

### âœ… 2. Enhanced Data Layer

#### Added Entity Auditing
- **Added `@PrePersist` and `@PreUpdate`** to all entities:
  - `User`, `Employee`, `Department`, `Role`
  - `LeaveType`, `LeaveRequest`, `Salary`
- **Automatic timestamps** for `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields

#### Created DTOs for Better API Design
- `EmployeeCreateDTO` - For employee creation requests
- `EmployeeResponseDTO` - For employee responses with computed fields
- `LeaveRequestDTO` - For leave request submissions
- `AttendanceResponseDTO` - For attendance data with employee names

### âœ… 3. Enhanced Security Configuration

#### Added Password Encoder Bean
```java
@Bean
public BCryptPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
}
```

#### Enhanced Security Rules
- Proper role-based access control
- JWT token validation
- CORS configuration for frontend integration

### âœ… 4. Improved Service Layer

#### LeaveRequestService Enhancements
- Added `getLeaveRequestsByEmployee(Long employeeId)` method
- Implemented `approveLeave()` and `rejectLeave()` with proper audit trails
- Added proper employee lookup via `EmployeeRepository`

#### Service Method Standardization
- **LeaveTypeService**: Added `updateLeaveType()` method
- **SalaryService**: Enhanced with proper method signatures matching controllers
- **EmailNotificationService**: Aligned method names with controller expectations
- **DepartmentService**: Added `updateDepartment()` method
- **RoleService**: Added `updateRole()` method
- **UserService**: Added comprehensive `updateUser()` method

### âœ… 5. Global Error Handling

#### Created GlobalExceptionHandler
- Handles `RuntimeException`, `BadCredentialsException`, `AccessDeniedException`
- Returns structured error responses with timestamps
- Proper HTTP status codes for different error types

### âœ… 6. Repository Layer Updates

#### Enhanced LeaveRequestRepository
- Added `findByEmployeeId(Long employeeId)` method for direct employee ID lookup
- Maintained existing `findByEmployee(Employee employee)` for object-based queries

### âœ… 7. Complete API Documentation

#### Comprehensive README.md
- **Setup Instructions**: Step-by-step installation guide
- **API Reference**: Complete endpoint documentation with request/response examples
- **Testing Guide**: Curl commands for testing complete workflows
- **Security Documentation**: Role-based permissions and authentication flow
- **Database Schema**: Table descriptions and relationships

#### Build Scripts
- `build.sh` (Linux/Mac)
- `build.bat` (Windows)
- Automated compilation and packaging with success/error reporting

### âœ… 8. Controller Enhancements

#### Added Missing Update Endpoints
- `PUT /api/employees/{id}` - Update employee records
- `PUT /api/departments/{id}` - Update department information
- `PUT /api/roles/{id}` - Update role information
- `PUT /api/users/{id}` - Update user information

## ðŸš€ New Features Implemented

### 1. Complete CRUD Operations
All entities now support full Create, Read, Update, Delete operations with proper validation.

### 2. Audit Trail System
All database changes are automatically tracked with creation and modification timestamps.

### 3. Role-Based Security
- **ADMIN**: Full system access
- **MANAGER**: Employee and operational data management
- **EMPLOYEE**: Personal data and attendance management

### 4. Advanced Attendance System
- Automatic hour calculation
- Multiple status tracking (PRESENT, ABSENT, LEAVE)
- Date range queries and monthly reports

### 5. Leave Management Workflow
- Leave application submission
- Approval/rejection workflow with approver tracking
- Integration with attendance system

### 6. Salary Management
- Historical salary tracking
- Automatic net salary calculation
- Activation/deactivation controls

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### 1. Code Quality
- Consistent error handling across all services
- Proper null checks and validation
- Standardized response formats

### 2. Security Enhancements
- BCrypt password encoding
- JWT token-based authentication
- CORS configuration for frontend integration

### 3. Database Optimization
- Proper entity relationships
- Efficient query methods in repositories
- Automatic timestamp management

### 4. API Documentation
- Swagger UI integration
- Comprehensive endpoint documentation
- Request/response examples

## ðŸ§ª Testing Ready

### Complete Testing Workflow
1. **Setup Phase**: Admin account creation and master data setup
2. **Employee Phase**: User registration and profile creation  
3. **Operations Phase**: Attendance tracking, leave management
4. **Management Phase**: Approval workflows and reporting

### Validation Scripts
- Build validation with Maven
- Compilation error checking
- Dependencies verification
